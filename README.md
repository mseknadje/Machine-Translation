# 📝 🌍 Machine Translation Project 

Project goal: build a neural machine translation model using a Transformer encoder-decoder architecture. This project implements the transformer from scratch, without using existing library implementations of Transformers, building the pieces that go into the full architecture.

Main components for this project include:

1. Implementing a Transformer encoder block and a Transformer decoder block
2. Implementing the BLEU metric for evaluating machine translation
3. Visualizing the decoder attention during translation
